    <p>Another week of independent study, another medium.com article. This week:</p>
<h2><em>What Is Public?</em></h2>

<li>
<p>The Gist</p>
<ul>
<li>This article discusses the post-internet concept of "public," and the numerous
issues surrounding "public" content.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Good</p>
<ul>
<li>I absolutely <em>despise</em> Gawker and their entire network of sites, so I'm
always glad to see them disparaged by others.</li>
<li>That Facebook chart is terrifying.</li>
<li>The author's end goal is noble, so I respect that.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Bad</p>
<ul>
<li>"any of us might throw in a hashtag to gather our thoughts". I never want to
meet anyone who does that. Ever.</li>
<li>While I admit that Twitter and Facebook both have significant "anti-privacy
creep," this article seems to be written from the perspective that Twitter and
Facebook are mandatory. I acknowledge that the regular, average user of social
media is less technical than I; I would like to hope that people understand that
the entirety of their generated content is being indexed and monetized.
Sadly, I know that isn't the case.</li>
<li>This author apparently doesn't understand private messaging, or other
methods of communication besides Twitter and Facebook. There are a <em>vast</em>
number of options for less-public communication on the internet, ranging from casual to
paranoid.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Questions</p>
<ul>
<li>Given that the legal system <em>enabled</em> things like the NSA's dragnet, does
legal reform for privacy / public content issues seem viable?</li>
<li>Should social media companies be more explicit about their privacy settings
and / or their business models?</li>
<li>Is this problem fixable, and if so, what would be some of the steps?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your Review</p>
<p>I don't like this article. A number of places in the article talk about consent and the
end user not being able to give it concerning their content. This is
fundamentally flawed - the user gives consent for whatever they post as soon
as they post it. While this may not be ideal, that is the
current state of the social media, and that is unlikely to change any time
soon. One's options are take the good with the bad, or simply don't use
social media.</p>
<p>While I agree that the wide variety of nastiness that can happen
online (swatting, doxxing, harassment, people sending pizzas) is deplorable,
there are also some positives to truly public content - educational value
(there have actually been some fascinating data aggregation projects),
and even the CDC <a href="http://fcw.com/articles/2013/01/25/flu-social-media.aspx" target="_blank">tracking and predicting the flu</a>. The internet, specifically social media is a terrifying beast,
but there are a number of cool things that come out of it. I don't think it's the
fault of the services themselves, but rather the small percentage of awful
people who use them for their own, malicious ends.</p>
<p>This is all scary, uncharted territory for both society and our legal system.
Who knows if (and how much) it has to get worse before it gets better, if it does at all.
At the end of the day, all of this is opt-in. If you can't deal with the
potential wretchedness that could rear its head, don't sign up!</p>
