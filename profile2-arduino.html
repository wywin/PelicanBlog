<p>Describe the software project, its purpose and goals.</p>
<ul>
<li>Arduino - Create an easy to use open hardware made for makers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Give brief history of the project. When was the Initial Commit? The latest commit?<ul>
<li>Initial commit: Thu Aug 25 21:06:28 2005 +0000</li>
<li>Latest commit: Likely within 24 hours</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Who approves patches? How many people?<ul>
<li>Arduino - Many people approve patches on their github repo. At first glance it looks like there are 15 people who can merge.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Who has commit access, or has had patches accepted? How many total?<ul>
<li>About 15 have commit access and it there are currently over 400 pull requests.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Has there been any turnover in the Core Team? (i.e. has the top 20% of contributors stayed the same over time? If not, how has it changed?)<ul>
<li>It seems many of the contributors only contribute for a short period of time. There are only a couple people who have continually contributed. <a href="https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/graphs/contributors" target="_blank">https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/graphs/contributors</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Does the project have a BDFL, or Lead Developer? (BDFL == Benevolent Dictator for Life)<ul>
<li>No there have been many people with commit access access and many of the developers have contributed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Are the front and back end developers the same people? What is the proportion of each?<ul>
<li>N/A</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What have been some of the major bugs/problems/issues that have arisen during development? Who is responsible for quality control and bug repair?<ul>
<li><a href="http://forum.arduino.cc/?board=56.0" target="_blank">http://forum.arduino.cc/?board=56.0</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How is the project's participation trending and why?<ul>
<li>It is increasing slowly. <a href="https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/graphs/contributors" target="_blank">https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/graphs/contributors</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In your opinion, does the project pass "The Raptor Test?" (i.e. Would the project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a Velociraptor?) Why or why not?<ul>
<li>Yes I believe it would survive because there are others that are actively contributing to the project and know their way around the project.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or most active 20% of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not?<ul>
<li>It would probably survive but would take a while to recover.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Does the project have an official "on-boarding" process in place? (new contributor guides, quickstarts, communication leads who focus specifically on newbies, etc...)<ul>
<li>Using the software there are plenty of guides.<ul>
<li>If you’re looking to contribute to the project I can’t seem to find anything besides their Contributor License Agreement (<a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ContributorLicenseAgreement" target="_blank">http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ContributorLicenseAgreement</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Does the project have Documentation available? Is it extensive? Does it include code examples?<ul>
<li>Yes Tons. It’s everywhere on their official site and even on the 3rd party sites explaining how to use arduinos.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you were going to contribute to this project, but ran into trouble or hit blockers, who would you contact, and how?<ul>
<li>Probably the IRC channel. #arduino on freenode</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Based on these answers, how would you describe the decision making structure/process of this group? Is it hierarchical, consensus building, ruled by a small group, barely contained chaos, or ruled by a single or pair of individuals?<ul>
<li>It seems like the project is ruled by a small group.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is this the kind of structure you would enjoy working in? Why, or why not?<ul>
<li>Yeah I believe they do a good job with structure and are continually on top of pull requests and issues.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
