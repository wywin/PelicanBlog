<li>N/A</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Who approves patches? How many people?<ul>
<li>There is a fantastically large list of commiters organized by project: <a href="https://people.apache.org/committers-by-project" target="_blank">https://people.apache.org/committers-by-project</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Who has commit access, or has had patches accepted? How many total?<ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Has there been any turnover in the Core Team? (i.e. has the top 20% of contributors stayed the same over time? If not, how has it changed?)<ul>
<li>N/A. The Apache Software Foundation has an elected board of directors.</li>
</ul>

<li>N/A</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How is the project's participation trending and why?<ul>
<li>Up, the number of current members is quite large. It may be that they don’t demote users for inactivity, so it is a false sense of growth.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In your opinion, does the project pass "The Raptor Test?" (i.e. Would the project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a Velociraptor?) Why or why not?<ul>
<li>Yes, the foundation is mainly run by the community so many people would be able step and take over the role.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or most active 20% of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not?<ul>
<li>Yes. The Apache Software Foundation board of directors is elected.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Does the project have an official "on-boarding" process in place? (new contributor guides, quickstarts, communication leads who focus specifically on newbies, etc...)<ul>
<li>There is a “Get Involved” landing page that directs users to further information: <a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/getinvolved.html" target="_blank">https://www.apache.org/foundation/getinvolved.html</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Does the project have Documentation available? Is it extensive? Does it include code examples?<ul>
<li>The ASF has a “top-level” wiki. “This General Wiki is a top-level overview of other wikis at the Apache Software Foundation, as well as overall Foundation-level information, at the bottom of this page.” (<a href="https://wiki.apache.org/general/" target="_blank">https://wiki.apache.org/general/</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you were going to contribute to this project, but ran into trouble or hit blockers, who would you contact, and how?<ul>
<li>IRC would likely be the first place to go.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Based on these answers, how would you describe the decision making structure/process of this group? Is it hierarchical, consensus building, ruled by a small group, barely contained chaos, or ruled by a single or pair of individuals?<ul>
<li>Consensus building.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is this the kind of structure you would enjoy working in? Why, or why not?<ul>
<li>The ASF has extensive documentation and guides to getting started on any of the numerous projects it oversees - it seems inviting and friendly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
