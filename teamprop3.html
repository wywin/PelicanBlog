<h3>Which Entity did your team choose to profile?</h3>
<p>Flattr</p>
<h3>Description of the Organization?</h3>
<p>Flattr is a Sweden-based microdonation provider founded by Peter Sunde and Linus Olsson and launched in March 2010. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flattr" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flattr</a>)</p>
<h3>Description of the project?</h3>
<p>In March 2010 Flattr launched via an invitation-only basis and then opened to the public on 12 August of the same year.</p>
<p>Flattr is a project started by Peter Sunde and Linus Olsson. Users are able to pay a small amount every month (minimum 2 euros) and then click Flattr buttons on sites to share the money they paid among those sites, comparable to an Internet tip jar. (The word "flattr" is used as a verb, to indicate payments through the Flattr system-so when a user clicks a Flattr button and they are logged in to the Flattr site, they are said to be "flattring" the page they are on.) Sunde said, "We want to encourage people to share money as well as content."</p>
<p>In the beginning of the service, Flattr itself takes 10% of all the users' monthly flatrate, although this fee may be reduced at a later date if the economics permit it.</p>
<p>In December 2010, Flattr received large-scale attention when it was tweeted to be a method of donating money to WikiLeaks, which had recently been cut off by PayPal, Visa, and MasterCard.</p>
<p>On 28 April 2011, Flattr announced by email that they would not require users to flattr others before they could be flattrd themselves, starting from 1 May 2011.</p>
<p>On 16 April 2013, Twitter announced that they would no longer allow Flattr users to Flattr favorites citing commercial confusion problems they believed would occur between users.</p>

<h3>Describe each team member's role?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Wyatt Winters (Lead Writer)</li>
<li>Caleb Coffie (Lead Researcher)</li>
<li>Aaron Herting (Lead Slide-maker)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Organization/Project Source Code Repository URL?</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/flattr" target="_blank">https://github.com/flattr</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>What do you anticipate the easy parts will be?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Flattr has been around for a while, and has a decently sized userbase.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What do you anticipate the hard parts will be?</h3>
<ul>
<li>It isn't terribly specific to open source, so writing the profile will require some creativity.</li>
</ul>
<p>(The part after this is still the same as other teamprops...)</p>
<h3>How will you overcome both?</h3>
<p>The only way to overcome the large hurdles will be to just keep going with the work. Over time many of the confusing parts should be cleared up. We can also contact fellow classmates if we have problems and they might be able to help out.</p>
<h3>If something goes wrong, what contingencies do you have in place?</h3>
<p>The only thing that I think might go wrong is a lack of information. To overcome this we can attempt to make contact with those involved in the projects and see if they're able to shed some light on the remaining information.</p>
<h3>When will your group meet regularly outside of class time?</h3>
<p>10:30 AM Tues / Thurs.</p>
