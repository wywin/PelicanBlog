    <h3>Rationale</h3>
<p>Wordpress is a gigantic thing. It powers (at least) 23% of the web. (<a href="http://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress/all/all" target="_blank">http://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress/all/all</a>) We wanted to dive deeper into what the community looks like that generates such a massively popular piece of software.</p>
<p>It was also one of the suggested ones, so that is also a reason.</p>

<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">https://wordpress.org/</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Describe the software project, its purpose and goals.<ul>
<li>Wordpress is a blogging platform and CMS. “...the mission of the WordPress open source project: to democratize publishing through Open Source, GPL software.” (<a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Policies" target="_blank">http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Policies</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Give brief history of the project. When was the Initial Commit? The latest commit?<ul>
<li>First commit: Tue Apr 1 06:17:43 2003 +0000</li>
<li>Probably in the last 24 hours.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Who approves patches? How many people?<ul>
<li>It appears that the people who approve patches and those who have commit access are the same group.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Who has commit access, or has had patches accepted? How many total?<ul>
<li>There are 42 people in the log of the SVN, so most likely a number smaller than 42 (assuming some people have since retired from contributing).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Has there been any turnover in the Core Team? (i.e. has the top 20% of contributors stayed the same over time? If not, how has it changed?)<ul>
<li>There is a list of “Developer Emeriti”, comprised of 10 people. (<a href="https://wordpress.org/about/" target="_blank">https://wordpress.org/about/</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Does the project have a BDFL, or Lead Developer? (BDFL == Benevolent Dictator for Life)<ul>
<li>Lead Developers: (<a href="https://wordpress.org/about/" target="_blank">https://wordpress.org/about/</a>)</li>
<li>Helen Hou-Sandí</li>
<li>Dion Hulse</li>
<li>Mark Jaquith</li>
<li>Matt Mullenweg</li>
<li>Andrew Nacin</li>
<li>Andrew Ozz</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Are the front and back end developers the same people? What is the proportion of each?<ul>
<li>There are 4 people listed as “design”, so we will call them front end devs for our purposes. Discarding the non-differentiated “contributing developers”, that leaves a 4/6 split for frontend/backend.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What have been some of the major bugs/problems/issues that have arisen during development? Who is responsible for quality control and bug repair?<ul>
<li>A vast majority of Wordpress vulns are a result of third-party plugins, and as such, do not fall under the umbrella of the core project.</li>
<li>No major bugs / vulns in core Wordpress were highly publicized.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How is the project's participation trending and why?<ul>
<li>The project’s number of contributors is difficult to gauge accurately - because of the architecture of the community, a large number of contributions via patches get “filtered” through a smaller number of people. As such, the number of contributors has remained roughly the same over time. (<a href="https://www.openhub.net/p/wordpress" target="_blank">https://www.openhub.net/p/wordpress</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In your opinion, does the project pass "The Raptor Test?" (i.e. Would the project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a Velociraptor?) Why or why not?<ul>
<li>Yes, because there are numerous people with access to the main repo.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or most active 20% of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not?<ul>
<li>Maybe not - the access to the main repo seems limited at best, and consequently the most active are the ones who have access.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Does the project have an official "on-boarding" process in place? (new contributor guides, quickstarts, communication leads who focus specifically on newbies, etc...)<ul>
<li>There is a Contributor Handbook, but it’s in a very rough state: <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/" target="_blank">https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Does the project have Documentation available? Is it extensive? Does it include code examples?<ul>
<li>User documentation is at: <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/" target="_blank">http://codex.wordpress.org/</a></li>
<li>Code documentation is at: <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/" target="_blank">https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Both sets of documentation are extensive.</li>
<li>If you were going to contribute to this project, but ran into trouble or hit blockers, who would you contact, and how?<ul>
<li>Asking in the Slack most likely, but it appears to be invite only / requires approval before accounts can be created.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Based on these answers, how would you describe the decision making structure/process of this group? Is it hierarchical, consensus building, ruled by a small group, barely contained chaos, or ruled by a single or pair of individuals?<ul>
<li>It’s a small group - one can only make changes with discrete patch files, not pull requests. Patches are submitted to the bug tracker (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/" target="_blank">https://core.trac.wordpress.org/</a>) and assessed / merged from there by core devs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is this the kind of structure you would enjoy working in? Why, or why not?<ul>
<li>While the strict structure resulted in a very robust and very stable core product, it feels difficult to contribute. It also feels a little too reliant on a small group of people.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Technology/Product (Section adapted from <a href="http://www.teachingcopyright.org/handout/technology-history-worksheet" target="_blank">EFF Worksheet</a>)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Who invented, created, or sponsored the technology?<ul>
<li>Matt Mullenweg and Mike Little founded Automattic Inc. to (initially) work on Wordpress.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What was the technology designed to do? How was it used?<ul>
<li>“...the mission of the WordPress open source project: to democratize publishing through Open Source, GPL software.” (<a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Policies" target="_blank">http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Policies</a>)</li>
<li>It is a browser based CMS / blogging platform.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Who would benefit from using this technology?<ul>
<li>Anyone who wants to publish content, written or otherwise, easily online.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What kinds of companies or organizations (stakeholders) might have been concerned about the development of this technology? Why?<ul>
<li>Developers of other (commercial) blogging platforms, governments wishing to squelch dissent, and people who generally dislike blogs for whatever reason.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Did an aspect of copyright law play a role in controversies about the technology? How?<ul>
<li>A case of a fraudulent DMCA (fairly recent as well!): <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/9/8175491/wordpress-automattic-wins-dmca-takedown-straight-pride-uk-case" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/9/8175491/wordpress-automattic-wins-dmca-takedown-straight-pride-uk-case</a></li>
