    <h1 class="title"> Getting a FOSS minor when you are bad at coding</h1>
    <p class=date> 2015 03 11 </p>
    <p>I'm not good at coding. Well, that's perhaps not true. I <em>feel</em> like I'm bad at
 coding. That's why I don't do it a whole lot. Of course, the only way to get
 better at something is to <em>do</em> it, but it's difficult to get better when you
 don't actually know if you're doing anything wrong. My code <em>works</em> (eventually)
 sure, but if all my variables are constructed the wrong way and if you do anything
 unexpected it catches fire, that's not exactly great code, is it? I could go find
 resources and train myself to write better code and have better practices,
 but I can't really be bothered, since I don't write code all that often. It's
 a vicious cycle.</p>
<p>Yet, for some reason, I'm taking (more accurately finishing) this FOSS minor.
I don't regret it, as it has been super fun and educational, but it feels weird
when I do so little coding. I help FOSS projects where I can - filing bug reports
(I can read code just fine), writing documentation, and so forth. I still feel
like a "lesser" FOSS contributor. I suppose I would be perfectly happy doing
these "lesser" things on my own, but when doing them for a grade, it gets
a little frustrating  and weird. At the same time though, the FOSS minor classes have
made me feel more comfortable getting into FOSS stuff, code or no code, so I
suppose it is progress.</p>
<p>And that's my serious blog post for now. Now I have to either come up with a way
to crash the ofCourse instance with my RSS feed, find some more extra credit,
or, I guess, actually write some more compelling posts. That first one seems
enticing.</p>
