    <h1 class="title"> FOSCIS Week 8</h1>
    <p class=date> 2015 03 29 </p>
    <p>This time, it's a full length movie film! And 4 pages of book scans! It still doesn't make sense, slightly delayed because of this Github DDoS, it's week 8 of FOSCIS:</p>

</ul>
</li>
<li>When<ul>
<li>1968 for "The Death of the Author"</li>
<li>2009 for <em>RiP: A Remix Manifesto</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Gist<ul>
<li>"Death" is a wildly incomprehensible essay about, as far as I can tell, how masterpieces of writing are those which the author is "dead" - his or her views and biases cease to exist inside the written work. Or something like that.</li>
<li><em>RiP</em> is (yet another) film about remix culture, copyright / fair use law, and everything in between.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Good<ul>
<li>Holy crap, that fake Disneyland in China is incredible. Apparently, there is an official Disney park opening <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Disney_Resort" target="_blank">quite soon</a>. (It's also confusing, as the text and spoken language was Japanese, but the video claims the park was in China. I assume that to be true, but still strange.)</li>
<li>I was not aware of Brazil's significant remix culture. How cool is it that their former Minister of Culture was also an active musician?</li>
<li>I think I actually stumbled across scans of Air Pirate comics <em>ages</em> ago, and had no idea about the backstory.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Bad<ul>
<li>I'm not sure what the best b-roll choice is when you want to play and focus on music, but having a tenth of your movie be people dancing is perhaps a bit redundant.</li>
<li>Speaking of redundant, after having watched <a href="http://everythingisaremix.info/" target="_blank"><em>Everything is a Remix</em></a> for BizLeg a few months back, this was more of the same, but better executed.</li>
<li>Good <em>God</em> is "Death" unreadable. This is becoming an alarming trend with these sloppily-scanned PDFs. I can't critique it very much, as that would require thorough understanding.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Questions<ul>
<li>There seems to be a number of vocal critics, but is change even possible given the <strong><em>vast</em></strong> amounts of money that copyright lobbying groups have?</li>
<li>Why was opensourcecinema.org shut down? </li>
<li>Were any revisions or derivative works created based on <em>RiP</em>?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your Review</p>
<ul>
<li>I quite enjoyed <em>RiP</em>, despite the fact that a good portion of it was preaching to the choir. I learned about some figures and areas of remix / open culture I didn't previously know about, and got to watch people dancing for a disproportionate amount of time! </li>
</ul>
<p>4/5 &lt;review increments></p>
<ul>
<li>As for "Death", well, you know. I guess I'm just not on a high enough arcane plane to comprehend it...</li>
</ul>
<p>1/5 &lt;review increments></p>
