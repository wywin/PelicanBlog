    <h1 class="title"> FOSCIS Week 5</h1>
    <p class=date> 2015 03 01 </p>
    <p>Two readings this week, so I guess I'll do a section for each.</p>
<p>First:</p>
<h2><em>Removing Knowledge</em></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Who</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~hsdept/bios/galison.html" target="_blank">Peter Galison</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.fas.harvard.edu/%7Ehsdept/bios/docs/Removing%20Knowledge.pdf" target="_blank"><em>Removing Knowledge</em></a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.fas.harvard.edu/%7Ehsdept/bios/docs/Removing%20Knowledge.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.fas.harvard.edu/%7Ehsdept/bios/docs/Removing%20Knowledge.pdf</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>When</p>
<ul>
<li>"Autumn" 2004, based on the copyright.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Gist</p>
<ul>
<li>This article discusses the ever-growing domain of the United States' classification of information, and (in no uncertain terms) the numerous downsides of that power creep.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Good</p>
<ul>
<li>"What is the level of damage (“damage,” “serious damage,” or “exceptionally grave damage”)..." That's a steep curve of clasification.</li>
<li>"Under the Atomic Energy Acts of 1946 and 1954... If I think of a new scheme for channeling X-rays from a fission primary to a thermonuclear secondary and write that idea down, I am (strictu sensu) forbidden from possessing the page I just created." I had no idea about those Acts. How did that make sense to include?!</li>
<li>"We probably would not know if a national security secret was as well-kept as the secret of Coca-Cola"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Bad</p>
<ul>
<li>I understand Dr. Galison has a PhD, but can we reign in the $400 words? I like to think I have a pretty decent vocabulary, but there were a number of words I had to look up.</li>
<li>While being somewhat difficult to read, this was <em>not at all</em> engaging. While Dr. Galison is clearly passionate about this issue, I don't feel particularly swayed by the article.</li>
<li>"On the one side, an unaffordable, intractable, holist antiepistemology, on the other a ludicrously naive punctiform one." Well, time for a dictionary, huh.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Questions</p>
<ul>
<li>While the classified document catalog is massive, what percentage of it is academically / politically / scientifically interesting?</li>
<li>Is there any progress on classification reform since this paper was written?</li>
<li>Why does storing classified documents cost so much money?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your Review</p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe it's because I'm not in the highest-tier of academics, or perhaps I just have other things to worry about, but the issue raised in this paper doesn't interest me at all. Sure, transparency is great and all, but I've found (again, this is probably because I'm not a high-tier academic) most government documents terribly uninteresting. Maybe there's just a certain age you hit and a biological switch fires and you suddenly get super interested in politics? I guess I haven't gotten there yet.</li>

<h2><em>Geeks, Social Imaginaries, and Recursive Publics</em></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Who</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://kelty.org/" target="_blank">Christopher Kelty</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://kelty.org/or/papers/Kelty_CA_Geeks_2005.pdf" target="_blank"><em>Geeks, Social Imaginaries, and Recursive Publics</em></a></li>
</ul>

<ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>When</p>
<ul>
<li>2005, based on the copyright and filename.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Gist</p>
<ul>
<li>This document (exhaustively) discusses the anthropologically unique "social imaginary" that is the internet, its users, and the malleability of both the protocols and the discussion topics.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Good</p>
<ul>
<li>"Boston to Berlin to Bombay (Mumbai)" I love alliteration, even more so when it only accomplished through creative means. Good on you, Professor Kelty.</li>
<li>That list of job titles is fantastic.</li>
<li>"trying to take something off of the Internet is like trying to take pee out of a pool." I've never actually heard that one before. I'm well familiar with the concept, but never heard it articulated that way.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Bad</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm not a fan of the terms "geek" or "nerd". I feel like they have been co-opted and subsequently bastardized by businessmen trying to ride the "hip new cool wave" of Doctor Who and The Avengers. Seeing it in an academic paper is similarly disgusting to me, however appropriate it may or may not be.</li>
<li>"dot.com boom" - I'm not sure that's the standard syntax for that phenomenon...</li>
<li>This falls into a similar trap of the last document - the jargon (in this case anthropological) is so dense that readability for laymen such as myself is compromised. I suppose I'm not <em>really</em> the intended audience for this document, but still.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Questions</p>
<ul>
<li>How would this paper be different if written today, if at all?</li>
<li>Can the uniqueness of the internet from an anthropological perspective be used to improve / further understanding of other societies / groups / [anthropological unit of people]?</li>
<li>Is the internet still a subject of intense anthropological interest as it (apparently) was in 2005?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your Review</p>
<ul>
<li>This article was definitely more interesting than the last, but not by much. It may just be my cynical, reductionist approach to things, but it seems like the whole thesis of the paper is "People who like the same stuff get in groups to talk about it / make stuff; also, the internet is pretty cool, huh?" Perhaps I'm just jaded about the uniqueness of the internet because I have spent the majority of my life interacting with it. In addition, I've always been a little dismissive of cultural anthropology after I took a <em>startlingly</em> boring course in it, and this article isn't terribly different. That list of job titles was pretty incredible though.</li>
