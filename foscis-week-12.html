    <h1 class="title"> FOSCIS Week 12</h1>
    <p class=date> 2015 04 26 </p>
    <p>Man, this week is jam-packed with stuff to read. It's not all that much in terms of word count, but it makes the writing-about-it part difficult. Oh well.</p>
<ul>
<li>Who<ul>
<li>Astra Taylor + Joanne McNeill</li>
<li><a href="http://igm.rit.edu/%7Eandy/" target="_blank">Andy Phelps</a></li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>What<ul>
<li>"The Dads of Tech"</li>
<li>"A Few Thoughts on GamerGate"</li>
<li>"Why the World Needs Anonymous" + "My Hacker, My Source, My Snitch"</li>
</ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>When<ul>
<li>Unknown, sometime in 2014</li>
<li>"2014-10-22T14:53:11.613Z" (medium.com won't tell you, unless you dig into the source. What?)</li>
<li>November 7, 2014 + "2014-11-10T14:42:27.951Z" (Seriously, medium. People like dates on articles. EDIT: It's light grey on white on the bottom status bar. Nice work guys.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Gist<ul>
<li>"The Dads of Tech" - A discussion of how the entire technology industry is run by old white dudes.</li>
<li>"A Few Thoughts on GamerGate" - As it says on the tin, thoughts about Gamergate, and the significant negative repercussions on the games industry as a whole.</li>
<li>"Why the World Needs Anonymous" - Again, as it says on the tin.</li>
<li>"My Hacker, My Source, My Snitch" - An past-tense interview / retrospective with "Sabu", the FBI Informant / Anon.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Good<ul>
<li>From "A Few Thoughts on GamerGate": "understanding that just because the internet makes certain behaviors possible, it doesn't make them morally or ethically appropriate"</li>
<li>From "Why the World Needs Anonymous": "you should care because Anonymous functions as a social laboratory where participants experiment with the power, threat, and promise of anonymity itself."</li>
<li>From "My Hacker, My Source, My Snitch": "tearing them a new network interface".</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Bad<ul>
<li>From "The Dads of Tech": "mansplain". First sentence in, and I'm already off-board. It's not even a clever portmanteau. Those two words don't have any sounds in common.</li>
<li>From "A Few Thoughts on GamerGate": "WikiPedia". Oh dear, Mr. Phelps. Oh dear.</li>
<li>From "The Dads of Tech": This is probably short-sighted and awful of me, because (believe it or not) I'm not a female in the technology industry, but man, do you need to write that much over such a problem? Yes, I understand things are unpleasant for females / non-males in the tech industry. I'm not sure that such angry articles are going to be read by your target audience, nor change their behaviors. It seems like a fools errand.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Questions<ul>
<li>As the Internet continues to form overlapping communities, is it prudent to try and label "groups" at this point? A single user can have affiliations with numerous groups and sites, so much so that labeling them "Anonymous" or "SJW" isn't really productive, or even completely accurate.</li>
<li>Is there anything individuals can do to help the "patriarchy" of the tech industry? (Besides not being a jerk, of course.)</li>
<li>What's up with gamergate these days? Is it still going on? Are people still being assholes? It kind of fell off the radar.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your Review</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>"The Dads of Tech"</p>
<ul>
<li>I mentioned it in "The Bad", but I don't understand why so many of these kinds of articles exist. I mean, yes, things are bad for some groups of people. This is true throughout the world, throughout industries and larger groups of people. Yes, things should be better. But most of the time, these articles seem to preach to the choir, both in terms of actual writing, and the usual audience for them. I generally try to avoid the news as much as possible (since it's usually awful and depressing), so maybe these type of articles are fixing the world without my noticing. But I doubt it.</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>"A Few Thoughts on GamerGate"</p>
<ul>
<li>This article is very much in the same vein as the last. I just don't see the point of complaining about assholes (on the internet or otherwise). You probably aren't going to "fix" them. The only thing one can do is <em>not</em> be an asshole, and try to offset the hate and anger that assholes do put into the world. At a certain point, it becomes a matter of "don't feed the trolls". </li>
</ul>
<p>2/5 &lt;review increments></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Why the World Needs Anonymous" </p>
<ul>
<li>Short, sweet, and well written.</li>
</ul>
<p>5/5 &lt;review increments></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"My Hacker, My Source, My Snitch"</p>
<ul>
<li>Again, well written, and fascinating. Somehow I managed to miss most of this whole fiasco. Or perhaps I didn't miss it, but simply forgot it as more and more nonsense was piled into my brain. Regardless, an interesting read.</li>
