<p>The Gist</p>
<ul>
<li>Chapter 4 specifically covers software patents, and the various obstacles
(and generic advice on defenses) that software patents create for FOSS projects
and developers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Good</p>
<ul>
<li>I have a much better understanding of why software patents are so hated -
they are confusing, and seem <em>designed</em> for exploitation and other nastiness.</li>
<li>I find that a legal organization (granted, in a general context) saying
"design around the obstacle patent" really humorous. That seems like a bad idea,
for a number of reasons.</li>
<li>This may be incorrect, but I'm left with the impression that, if one wants
to put in the work, most patents can be invalidated (relatively) easily?
That's encouraging, I suppose.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Bad</p>
<ul>
<li>I have difficulty understanding why this document was written. It seems like
every other paragraph is "consult legal counsel for specific needs" or similar.
Why wouldn't I just go to a lawyer to begin with? (S)he could probably tell
me all this information, perhaps more succinctly.</li>
<li>The whole section 4.3 "Becoming Aware of a Patent" seems really strange.
It (from what I understand) pretty much says "wait for them to come to you,
then get a lawyer". What?!</li>
<li>This chapter was even less readable than the last two. I understand why
lawyers get paid so much - this is difficult to understand, and incredibly
boring!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Questions</p>
<ul>
<li>Given the (from what I can tell) significant outrage about the current state
of software patents, is there or has there been any attempts at adjusting the laws
concerning software patents?</li>
<li>Of the patent troll cases I've heard of, why are patents granted to such
vague and generic software patents?</li>
<li>Who the heck comes up with the time periods in our legal system? Maintenance
fees are due every 4.5 years? You can seek damages for infringements occurring
up to 6 years in the past? <em>Why those numbers?!</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your Review</p>
<ul>
<li>While I did glean some useful knowledge from this chapter, I found most of it useless.
I feel like most sections were simply "you <em>could</em> do this, but you should
probably just talk to a lawyer". In addition, I'm not sure if I should be <em>more</em>
afraid of software patents, or <em>less</em> so since they seem easy to invalidate.
There was some solid content, but it was buried behind vast walls of legal
jargon.</li>
