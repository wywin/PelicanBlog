&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The TED talk was filmed July 2011&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;August 17, 2014&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;December 2014&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;November 18, 2014&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Gist&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"How algorithms shape our world" covers the rapid spread of algorithms into every aspect of life, even so far as to inspire terraforming to speed up those algorithms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Is the US Stock Market rigged?" covers the spread of algorithms into the magical world of the stock market, and it's "rigging" of the system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"The Truth About Anonymous’s Activism" and "Naming Nameless" are both essentially book reviews of "Hacker, Hoaxer, Whistleblower, Spy: The Many Faces of Anonymous".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Good&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The TED talk was engaging and humorous.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is entirely unrelated to pretty much anything, but I really like the idea of a "BATS Exchange". I'm sure it stands for something, but the idea of a stock exchange purely for bats and bat-related products is pretty funny. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From "Naming Nameless": "Perhaps the best way to confront Anonymous is not as a subject in a controlled study but as an environment to be understood."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Bad&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From "Is the US Stock Market rigged?": "robot computers". Let that sink in. Not just robots, not just computers, but ROBOT COMPUTERS!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's perhaps against the spirit of those whole exercise, but can I just put the entirety of "The Truth About Anonymous’s Activism" as a bad point? This first paragraph is something else. Oh, it gets even better: "Lulz, a corruption of "LOL". &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;It's like they haven't even seen that Fox News video!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Everything about this article seems ill-advised. Goodness. Also, the possessive form of "Anonymous" would be "Anonymous'". &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From "Naming Nameless": "That asshole that showed up to your prison-abolition march in a Guy Fawkes mask and started shouting about the Fed? That was probably Anonymous too." I mean, in so much that "Anonymous" doesn't formally exist, sure. You could also argue that &lt;em&gt;everyone else&lt;/em&gt; is also "probably Anonymous," just a different part.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Questions&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why is the algorithm-aziation of the world a net positive, or a net negative?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why do people seem so intent on making sweeping generalizations about an organization as large (and as loose) as Anonymous? Sure, they are quite an interesting group (or group of groups, depending on how you look at it), but what do we gain out of it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is "doxxing" spelled with one x or two?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your Review&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"How algorithms shape our world"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don't really understand why this talk was presented. Yes, there are algorithms on the backend of virtually every system in the world today. So, what next then? Do we blow up all the computers? Do we go deeper down the rabbit hole? Do we make vaguely-interesting speeches?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/5 &amp;lt;review increments&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Is the US Stock Market rigged?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The financial industry is broken? Weird.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/5 &amp;lt;review increments&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The Truth About Anonymous’s Activism" + "Naming Nameless"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I lumped these two articles together because they feel like the same thing, written by different people. I think the main problem I have with both writing about Anonymous and writing about those who write about Anonymous (which in itself is a little silly) is that Anonymous by its very nature is impossible to define. As such, how the hell does one right about it? Ms. Coleman apparently found enough to fill a book (which I have not read, so perhaps all these arguments are invalidated somehow), but what is to be gained from it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also feel like there is some sort of defensive aspect to this. I really like the internet, warts and all. It sounds stupid, but it feels less exciting and magical when we have anthropologists and other social science people coming in and trying to categorize and lump everyone into different camps. Why can't you just let the internet do its thing and be weird? Where everyone belongs dozens to hundreds of groups, without worrying about "fitting in"? I understand that the internet is becoming more and more "normal" every day, but the fact that someone can get &lt;em&gt;deep&lt;/em&gt; into rabbit holes about almost any topic on the planet is still pretty fantastic. It's hard to articulate, but I think trying to "study" the internet and internet communities does a disservice to everyone involved. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Unknown, sometime in 2014&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"2014-10-22T14:53:11.613Z" (medium.com won't tell you, unless you dig into the source. What?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;November 7, 2014 + "2014-11-10T14:42:27.951Z" (Seriously, medium. People like dates on articles. EDIT: It's light grey on white on the bottom status bar. Nice work guys.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Gist&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"The Dads of Tech" - A discussion of how the entire technology industry is run by old white dudes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"A Few Thoughts on GamerGate" - As it says on the tin, thoughts about Gamergate, and the significant negative repercussions on the games industry as a whole.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Why the World Needs Anonymous" - Again, as it says on the tin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"My Hacker, My Source, My Snitch" - An past-tense interview / retrospective with "Sabu", the FBI Informant / Anon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Good&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From "A Few Thoughts on GamerGate": "understanding that just because the internet makes certain behaviors possible, it doesn't make them morally or ethically appropriate"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From "Why the World Needs Anonymous": "you should care because Anonymous functions as a social laboratory where participants experiment with the power, threat, and promise of anonymity itself."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From "My Hacker, My Source, My Snitch": "tearing them a new network interface".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Bad&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From "The Dads of Tech": "mansplain". First sentence in, and I'm already off-board. It's not even a clever portmanteau. Those two words don't have any sounds in common.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From "A Few Thoughts on GamerGate": "WikiPedia". Oh dear, Mr. Phelps. Oh dear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From "The Dads of Tech": This is probably short-sighted and awful of me, because (believe it or not) I'm not a female in the technology industry, but man, do you need to write that much over such a problem? Yes, I understand things are unpleasant for females / non-males in the tech industry. I'm not sure that such angry articles are going to be read by your target audience, nor change their behaviors. It seems like a fools errand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Questions&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As the Internet continues to form overlapping communities, is it prudent to try and label "groups" at this point? A single user can have affiliations with numerous groups and sites, so much so that labeling them "Anonymous" or "SJW" isn't really productive, or even completely accurate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there anything individuals can do to help the "patriarchy" of the tech industry? (Besides not being a jerk, of course.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What's up with gamergate these days? Is it still going on? Are people still being assholes? It kind of fell off the radar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your Review&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The Dads of Tech"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I mentioned it in "The Bad", but I don't understand why so many of these kinds of articles exist. I mean, yes, things are bad for some groups of people. This is true throughout the world, throughout industries and larger groups of people. Yes, things should be better. But most of the time, these articles seem to preach to the choir, both in terms of actual writing, and the usual audience for them. I generally try to avoid the news as much as possible (since it's usually awful and depressing), so maybe these type of articles are fixing the world without my noticing. But I doubt it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/5 &amp;lt;review increments&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A Few Thoughts on GamerGate"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This article is very much in the same vein as the last. I just don't see the point of complaining about assholes (on the internet or otherwise). You probably aren't going to "fix" them. The only thing one can do is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be an asshole, and try to offset the hate and anger that assholes do put into the world. At a certain point, it becomes a matter of "don't feed the trolls". &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/5 &amp;lt;review increments&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Why the World Needs Anonymous" &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short, sweet, and well written.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/5 &amp;lt;review increments&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"My Hacker, My Source, My Snitch"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Again, well written, and fascinating. Somehow I managed to miss most of this whole fiasco. Or perhaps I didn't miss it, but simply forgot it as more and more nonsense was piled into my brain. Regardless, an interesting read.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Who&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://oddletters.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Molly Sauter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chapters 1 and 3 of &lt;em&gt;The Coming Swarm&lt;/em&gt;. The contents of chapter 2 shall remain a mystery, for some reason.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0BxvDQ-4qQO6dTUN5S3h6Mm1hOEk&amp;amp;usp=sharing" target="_blank"&gt;This random Google Drive link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The book is copyright 2014.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Gist&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chapter 1 discusses the similarities and differences between DDoS and "classical" civil disobedience techniques. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chapter 3 discusses the role of the mass media in the success of a DDoS attack as a political act.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Good&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chapter 3 had some excellent history, most of which I didn't previously know.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"if the actions taken by activists don't "look like" activism, or the views presented are too outside the mainstream to appeal to viewers - and advertisers - it is likely that these actions will not be covered at all."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I really liked the bit with "hacker-as-folk-devil."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Bad&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chapter 1 is yet again rife with philosophical and social scientific madness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I guess it's common in these "academic" type books, but the constant "as &amp;lt;name&gt; says, &amp;lt;something&gt;" gets a little difficult to read. If your book is just a bundle of other people's work, why did you write a book? This is less of an issue in Chapter 3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Activist DDoS actions and other types of disruptive activism are not random acts of vandalism; they are not simply shouting someone down with nonsensical noise." - I mean, "shouting someone down with nonsensical noise" is kind of the definition of a DDoS attack. I understand what Ms. Sauter means, but it's poorly phrased.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Questions&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are all DDoS attacks political in nature?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As DDoS mitigation (very slowly) improves, what's the next "online civil disobedience" method of choice?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your Review&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I feel like I'm always super negative with these reviews. This week was &lt;em&gt;vastly&lt;/em&gt; better than previous weeks, but still wasn't fantastic. My main point of contention is that &lt;em&gt;politically motivated&lt;/em&gt; DDoS attacks seem super rare, and even then, the political ties are shaky at best. The most recent Github DDoS was barely political, the Lizard Squad DDoS of PSN / Xbox Live over Christmas was &lt;em&gt;barely&lt;/em&gt; political (I vaguely heard them whining about corporate greed or some such nonsense at one point). Getting a good DDoS going is pretty trivial at this point - one can rent time on botnets pretty easily, or even buy "stress testing" services and point them wherever. DDoS is practically commonplace at this point, so they aren't nearly as special or worthy of attention anymore. I think that severely mitigates their political potential. The writing itself was fine, but I find the premise a little flawed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;2014&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Gist&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This article covers the development of general purpose computing and the ways it influenced (both positively and negatively) "freedom" (in various interpretations of the word).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Good&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In addition to being a really stupid acronym (which I'm a huge fan of), the WELL is apparently still running: &lt;a href="http://www.well.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.well.com/&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;""You lack political liberty or freedom only if you are prevented from attaining your goal by human beings” (Berlin 1958, 7)."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"J. C. R. Licklider" is a really funny name. Granted, he was pretty influential in computing history, but man. "Licklider".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Bad&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can't see the phrase "serious business" without giggling. Thanks internet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"I would like to do that by reference to a third domain: that of political philosophy." Oh, jeeze man, can you not? I'm still recovering from last week...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oddly enough, this is an article where I &lt;em&gt;dislike&lt;/em&gt; the frequent footnotes and annotations. When every other sentence is "Author (year)," it's hard to distinguish the original ideas in the text.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The acronyms "STS" and "MCS" are used like I am expected to know what they are. It took me a good couple minutes until I figured out they stand for "Science and Technology Studies" and "Media and Communications Studies" respectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Questions&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This article makes frequent use of the phrase "high tech industry". Is the low tech industry vibrant enough that the distinction is needed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"smartphones (note the focus on augmented intelligence in the very name)" - I thought the "smart" in "smartphone" referred to the phone itself. What's the etymology behind the term?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This text seems intent on slapping labels (such as "libertarian") on various technologies. Why is labeling things so important in philosophy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your Review&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I had hopes for this week. Maybe we would be out of philosophy-town. We are not out of philosophy town. That being said, it was still more readable than last week's assignment. There were a handful of fun computing history facts, but the majority of it was still philosophical madness. I can't tell if I'm getting a subpar version of this course by doing it as an independent study, or the "real" version of this course is equally baffling and crazy. We may never know.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Who&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/foucault/" target="_blank"&gt;Michel Foucault&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://artsites.ucsc.edu/faculty/Gustafson/FILM%20162.W10/readings/foucault.author.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;"What is an author?"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://artsites.ucsc.edu/faculty/Gustafson/FILM%20162.W10/readings/foucault.author.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://artsites.ucsc.edu/faculty/Gustafson/FILM%20162.W10/readings/foucault.author.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1969&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Gist&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is another philosophical paper about authors and authorship. It discusses the various forms an author can take, and the various transitions "authorship" has made throughout history.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Good&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I would be way more interested in "complete works" collections if it included laundry bills. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The footnotes are nice. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"The distinctive contribution of these authors is that they produced not only their own work, but the possibility and the rules of formation of other texts."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Bad&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two sentences in, and I'm already writing something in this section. The "author" is not really an open question. It's the person who wrote (assuming this is strictly a literary context) a thing. That's it. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Neither Hermes not[nor?] Hippocrates"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"What are the modes of existence of this discourse?"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Questions&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perhaps this made more sense in the "real" class, but these past couple readings have felt wildly out of place. Why were they included?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What happened to the annotations in the margins? Did the person annotating also get bored and subsequently distracted?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your Review&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don't "get" philosophy. This entire document seems like a crazy guy trying to redefine and bend the meaning of words, seemingly for the hell of it. I just don't see why any of it matters. Why would anyone care about this? "an anonymous poster attached to a wall may have a writer, but he cannot be an author." I mean, if you say so, man. It just seems pretentious and "intellectual" for its own sake. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;When&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1968 for "The Death of the Author"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2009 for &lt;em&gt;RiP: A Remix Manifesto&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Gist&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Death" is a wildly incomprehensible essay about, as far as I can tell, how masterpieces of writing are those which the author is "dead" - his or her views and biases cease to exist inside the written work. Or something like that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;RiP&lt;/em&gt; is (yet another) film about remix culture, copyright / fair use law, and everything in between.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Good&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Holy crap, that fake Disneyland in China is incredible. Apparently, there is an official Disney park opening &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Disney_Resort" target="_blank"&gt;quite soon&lt;/a&gt;. (It's also confusing, as the text and spoken language was Japanese, but the video claims the park was in China. I assume that to be true, but still strange.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was not aware of Brazil's significant remix culture. How cool is it that their former Minister of Culture was also an active musician?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think I actually stumbled across scans of Air Pirate comics &lt;em&gt;ages&lt;/em&gt; ago, and had no idea about the backstory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Bad&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm not sure what the best b-roll choice is when you want to play and focus on music, but having a tenth of your movie be people dancing is perhaps a bit redundant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of redundant, after having watched &lt;a href="http://everythingisaremix.info/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everything is a Remix&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for BizLeg a few months back, this was more of the same, but better executed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good &lt;em&gt;God&lt;/em&gt; is "Death" unreadable. This is becoming an alarming trend with these sloppily-scanned PDFs. I can't critique it very much, as that would require thorough understanding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Questions&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There seems to be a number of vocal critics, but is change even possible given the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;vast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; amounts of money that copyright lobbying groups have?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why was opensourcecinema.org shut down? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Were any revisions or derivative works created based on &lt;em&gt;RiP&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your Review&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I quite enjoyed &lt;em&gt;RiP&lt;/em&gt;, despite the fact that a good portion of it was preaching to the choir. I learned about some figures and areas of remix / open culture I didn't previously know about, and got to watch people dancing for a disproportionate amount of time! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/5 &amp;lt;review increments&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As for "Death", well, you know. I guess I'm just not on a high enough arcane plane to comprehend it...&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Piracy&lt;/em&gt; has a copyright date of 2009&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Author" has a copyright date of 1995&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Gist&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Piracy&lt;/em&gt; (chapters 1 and 2 at least) tells the tale of the origin of "piracy",
in the era of the printing press. Chapter 1 is an overview of the rest of
the book, as well as a handful of anecdotes about piracy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Author" is a very dense philosophical article about the word "author", its
various uses and definitions, and how it they have changed over time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Good&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I had never heard the anecdote about the pirate version NEC. That's dedication
to a ruse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"has even outlawed the promulgation of algorithms that might be used to
disable or circumvent copy-protection" - I knew the DMCA was stupid, I didn't
know it was THAT stupid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a fan of etymology, it was interesting to read the &lt;em&gt;detailed&lt;/em&gt; history
of the word "author".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Bad&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Readers and commentators in the blogosphere reproduced the original press
 reports many times over." Yes, the blogosphere. That thing that still exists.
 (I know this is from 2009, but that still feels dated to use "blogosphere")&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Author" is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;incredibly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; dense. I struggled to read it. I generally
don't have much difficulty with reading stuff (in English at least), but this
one was a challenge. I don't know if it was the scan, the font, or what; but
it was &lt;em&gt;physically&lt;/em&gt; difficult to read as well as academically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"The utterly textual milieu of the poststructuralists is ruled by the critic,
or the authorless subject, as opposed to the author." If you say so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Questions&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How did robbery at sea turn into a term used for copyright infringement?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why have territorial borders always played such a role in copyright? It
makes sense in older times when copying works was more difficult, but why
is it still such an issue today?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does the future of piracy look like?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your Review&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Piracy&lt;/em&gt; is an interesting read, and I may end up picking up the full version.
It is readable (definitely more so than "Author"), and relatively engaging.
I can always nitpick some word choice or grammar usage, but it seems well
written.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Author" is nigh unreadable. The jargon is packed so densely (as well as
the text itself!) that it is difficult to comprehend. I'm not a fan of
philosophy in general, and this did little to change my mind on the matter.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mr. Bogost's article is dated 2014-05-15.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ms. Glaser's article is dated 2014-09-10.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mr. Bogost's article questions the value of net neutrality, the validity of the openness of the current internet, and the (perceived) negative effects of the internet on daily life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ms. Glaser's article takes a decidedly opposite stance, spelling out the numerous potential dangers of a non-neutral internet, and (as is typical of the EFF) a call to action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Good&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ms. Glaser's article is well cited, and gives specific examples of adverse effects enabled by not having strong net neutrality laws.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While I vehemently oppose almost all of the ideas presented in it, Mr. Bogost's article is quite well written. "The weight and heat of your smartphone in your pocket, silently whimpering for you, a glass and metal kitten with a small, fragile body."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From Ms. Glaser's article: "This is a particular concern as more Internet providers expand into content production and distribution. Network discrimination could be used to herd users towards services the ISPs offer, like Verizon’s RedBox, rather than their competitors." - This was always one of the examples I gave when having to explain net neutrality to someone less technically-oriented.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bad&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ian Bogost must be a profoundly unhappy man. He seems to have little hope, is dismissive, and wants to (apparently) let the internet burn. I feel like this article is largely dominated by emotion, and has immense leaps in logic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He seems to think that because giants like Facebook and Twitter exist, that new players can't enter the field. As such, implementing laws that hold that door open (however narrow it may be) are pointless. Sure, you may think things are bad, but why would not at least try to keep things from getting worse? Why would you just give up?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This seems to be a common thread in the (admittedly very small) selection of anti-net-neutrality / anti-anonymity articles I have read - the authors seem to think that social media services are mandatory! "Sitting in front of the television, you grasp your iPhone tight in your hand instead of your knitting or your whiskey or your rosary or your lover." I mean, you don't have to. You are more than welcome to pick up any of those other objects (or people, as the case may be).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"You boot a browser and it loads the Yahoo! homepage" - so &lt;em&gt;that's&lt;/em&gt; why this guy is so jaded by the internet. I would be too, if I had to look at Yahoo! every time I loaded my browser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Questions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the FCC's Title II ruling "save" the internet, or are there still more steps to take?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When do the new laws go into effect?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have there been any scientific studies on adverse effects / mental health implications of Mr. Bogost's so called "sins" that he outlines?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your Review&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I got most of it out in the "the bad" section, but holy crap, I couldn't agree less with Mr. Bogost. I mean, yeah, there are some super awful parts of the internet, and that sucks. There are also super awful parts of the real world, and that also sucks. I'm not sure giving up on fixing the internet and letting it get monetized and corrupted into an unrecognizable nightmare is the best course of action. If someone's being a jerk, don't engage them, block them, and move on. The benefits of the internet (especially a neutral one) &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; outweight the negatives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bogost - -3/5 &amp;lt;review increments&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ms. Glaser's article is much more to my liking, and not only because its ideas are much more in line with my own. It is less emotional (although there are still a handful of weasel words), and provides very clear, specific, and cited examples.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This article discusses the ever-growing domain of the United States' classification of information, and (in no uncertain terms) the numerous downsides of that power creep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Good&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"What is the level of damage (“damage,” “serious damage,” or “exceptionally grave damage”)..." That's a steep curve of clasification.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Under the Atomic Energy Acts of 1946 and 1954... If I think of a new scheme for channeling X-rays from a fission primary to a thermonuclear secondary and write that idea down, I am (strictu sensu) forbidden from possessing the page I just created." I had no idea about those Acts. How did that make sense to include?!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"We probably would not know if a national security secret was as well-kept as the secret of Coca-Cola"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bad&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I understand Dr. Galison has a PhD, but can we reign in the $400 words? I like to think I have a pretty decent vocabulary, but there were a number of words I had to look up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While being somewhat difficult to read, this was &lt;em&gt;not at all&lt;/em&gt; engaging. While Dr. Galison is clearly passionate about this issue, I don't feel particularly swayed by the article.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"On the one side, an unaffordable, intractable, holist antiepistemology, on the other a ludicrously naive punctiform one." Well, time for a dictionary, huh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Questions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While the classified document catalog is massive, what percentage of it is academically / politically / scientifically interesting?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there any progress on classification reform since this paper was written?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why does storing classified documents cost so much money?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your Review&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe it's because I'm not in the highest-tier of academics, or perhaps I just have other things to worry about, but the issue raised in this paper doesn't interest me at all. Sure, transparency is great and all, but I've found (again, this is probably because I'm not a high-tier academic) most government documents terribly uninteresting. Maybe there's just a certain age you hit and a biological switch fires and you suddenly get super interested in politics? I guess I haven't gotten there yet.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This document (exhaustively) discusses the anthropologically unique "social imaginary" that is the internet, its users, and the malleability of both the protocols and the discussion topics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Good&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Boston to Berlin to Bombay (Mumbai)" I love alliteration, even more so when it only accomplished through creative means. Good on you, Professor Kelty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That list of job titles is fantastic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"trying to take something off of the Internet is like trying to take pee out of a pool." I've never actually heard that one before. I'm well familiar with the concept, but never heard it articulated that way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bad&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm not a fan of the terms "geek" or "nerd". I feel like they have been co-opted and subsequently bastardized by businessmen trying to ride the "hip new cool wave" of Doctor Who and The Avengers. Seeing it in an academic paper is similarly disgusting to me, however appropriate it may or may not be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"dot.com boom" - I'm not sure that's the standard syntax for that phenomenon...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This falls into a similar trap of the last document - the jargon (in this case anthropological) is so dense that readability for laymen such as myself is compromised. I suppose I'm not &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; the intended audience for this document, but still.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Questions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How would this paper be different if written today, if at all?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can the uniqueness of the internet from an anthropological perspective be used to improve / further understanding of other societies / groups / [anthropological unit of people]?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the internet still a subject of intense anthropological interest as it (apparently) was in 2005?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your Review&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This article was definitely more interesting than the last, but not by much. It may just be my cynical, reductionist approach to things, but it seems like the whole thesis of the paper is "People who like the same stuff get in groups to talk about it / make stuff; also, the internet is pretty cool, huh?" Perhaps I'm just jaded about the uniqueness of the internet because I have spent the majority of my life interacting with it. In addition, I've always been a little dismissive of cultural anthropology after I took a &lt;em&gt;startlingly&lt;/em&gt; boring course in it, and this article isn't terribly different. That list of job titles was pretty incredible though.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This article discusses the post-internet concept of "public," and the numerous
issues surrounding "public" content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Good&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I absolutely &lt;em&gt;despise&lt;/em&gt; Gawker and their entire network of sites, so I'm
always glad to see them disparaged by others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That Facebook chart is terrifying.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The author's end goal is noble, so I respect that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bad&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"any of us might throw in a hashtag to gather our thoughts". I never want to
meet anyone who does that. Ever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While I admit that Twitter and Facebook both have significant "anti-privacy
creep," this article seems to be written from the perspective that Twitter and
Facebook are mandatory. I acknowledge that the regular, average user of social
media is less technical than I; I would like to hope that people understand that
the entirety of their generated content is being indexed and monetized.
Sadly, I know that isn't the case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This author apparently doesn't understand private messaging, or other
methods of communication besides Twitter and Facebook. There are a &lt;em&gt;vast&lt;/em&gt;
number of options for less-public communication on the internet, ranging from casual to
paranoid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Questions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given that the legal system &lt;em&gt;enabled&lt;/em&gt; things like the NSA's dragnet, does
legal reform for privacy / public content issues seem viable?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should social media companies be more explicit about their privacy settings
and / or their business models?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is this problem fixable, and if so, what would be some of the steps?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your Review&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't like this article. A number of places in the article talk about consent and the
end user not being able to give it concerning their content. This is
fundamentally flawed - the user gives consent for whatever they post as soon
as they post it. While this may not be ideal, that is the
current state of the social media, and that is unlikely to change any time
soon. One's options are take the good with the bad, or simply don't use
social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I agree that the wide variety of nastiness that can happen
online (swatting, doxxing, harassment, people sending pizzas) is deplorable,
there are also some positives to truly public content - educational value
(there have actually been some fascinating data aggregation projects),
and even the CDC &lt;a href="http://fcw.com/articles/2013/01/25/flu-social-media.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;tracking and predicting the flu&lt;/a&gt;. The internet, specifically social media is a terrifying beast,
but there are a number of cool things that come out of it. I don't think it's the
fault of the services themselves, but rather the small percentage of awful
people who use them for their own, malicious ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all scary, uncharted territory for both society and our legal system.
Who knows if (and how much) it has to get worse before it gets better, if it does at all.
At the end of the day, all of this is opt-in. If you can't deal with the
potential wretchedness that could rear its head, don't sign up!&lt;/p&gt;

In order to finish my FOSS minor at RIT, I am doing an independent study adaptation of a pre-existing course. Because of scheduling conflicts, I cannot take it normally before I graduate, and this is the last requirement to finish out the minor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing an independent study version of a class that is very much focused around
reading and group discussion is perhaps a bit suboptimal, but I have been tasked with
writing blog posts / reviews of the readings in lieu of group discussions. It will certainly be an adventure. So, here's the first one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;Software, It’s a Thing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2014-07-24&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This article is the transcript of the opening address at the Library of Congress' &lt;a href="http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/meetings/ndiipp14.html" target="_blank"&gt;Digital Preservation 2014&lt;/a&gt; conference. The author addresses the complexities of software as a "thing", and the difficulties that those complexities introduce to the archival and preservation of software in general.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Good&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's a fantastically organized and written piece of prose. I have never given too much thought about the various forms software can take, and, while some of the forms were perhaps a stretch, it was weird to think of software as "epigraphy". It's kind of strange / terrifying to contemplate all the places one's name or data appears on various computer / software systems throughout the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"... is content enough? What counts as context for all our digital content?" This is a pretty serious issue, especially with older software. Trying to play almost any older C64 / Atari 2600 game is nigh-impossible without the manual. Sure, you can dump ROMs and put them on a server without breaking a sweat, but without the associated manuals and documentation, they aren't nearly as useful or interesting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reading this article made me remember to fire up my &lt;a href="http://www.archiveteam.org/index.php?title=ArchiveTeam_Warrior" target="_blank"&gt;ArchiveTeam Warrior&lt;/a&gt; which I hadn't in a while. I might as well put all this spare RIT bandwidth to good use!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bad&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That title is pretty bad. Granted, some of the titles I have come up with aren't fantastic, but jeeze. Honorary mention for "Preserving.exe". Yeesh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These weren't the author's words, but Thomas Scoville's quote about code and jazz was excruciating. Maybe it's my distaste for jazz, or maybe I haven't been able to have code "flow" as Mr. Scoville describes, but that analogy seems like grasping at very distant straws.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The "software as clickwrap" section was so short that it seemed like an afterthought. Software distribution does seem to be going increasingly in that direction, so why not discuss it more thoroughly?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Questions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is software preservation actually as difficult as it is made out to be in this article, or is just a manpower / volume issue?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why is software a "lesser priority" for the archival / preservation community?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has the DMCA or other copyright restrictions significantly hindered software archival efforts?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your Review&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As someone who has been vaguely interested in software archival (and spent a fair amount of time browsing around Archive.org), this was a pretty interesting article. While I don't completely agree with everything presented, it was certainly thought provoking, and perhaps a little distressing. It's alarming to consider the future of all these server based products which likely will cease to exist in their current form at some point. A number of MMO games have disappeared, and can never be played again. It's weird to consider that possibility for a majority of the software tools I use every day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
