Having to write on this site this often is weird. I had gotten into such a deep
rut of assuming "oh, that's not really worthy of a blog post" about nearly
everything I do (so much so that I hadn't posted anything in like 15 months),
that having to write blog posts (for grades!) this frequently, on a variety of
topics, seems quite strange. Given how relatively surgical and calculated my previous posts have
been, this continues to be a foreign practice to me. Hopefully it will get more
comfortable (or I will stop irrationally worrying about every little thing that
I post. If I go for volume, maybe people won't see the occasional dumb thing I post!)

Onto the assignments for this week:

<div id="vidreview0"></div>

##[Assignment 1: "Vidreview0"](#vidreview0)

- Who
    - [Kirby Ferguson](https://twitter.com/remixeverything){target=_blank}

- What
    - [*Everything is a Remix*](http://everythingisaremix.info/){target=_blank}

- Where
    - [http://everythingisaremix.info/watch-the-series/](http://everythingisaremix.info/watch-the-series/){target=_blank}

- When
    - The fourth and final part was released 2012-02-15.

- The Gist
    - This is a well done (and exhaustively sourced) documentary-of-sorts about
    the history, impacts, and interactions between copyright, patent law, creative
    culture, and (as the title would suggest) remixing.

- The Good
    - The production values were quite good, and it was obvious Mr. Ferguson put
    a lot of effort into it.
    - I'm always a fan of not-actually-copyright-notice screens. This one wasn't
    particularly funny, but still an excellent use of the trope.
    - I have no idea why, but the animated sequence at 9:25 at least on [this copy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coGpmA4saEk){target=_blank} was maybe my favorite part.
    Very Sesame Street-esque.

- The Bad
    - The Youtube version I was linked had some serious compression and artifacting.
    - It's common in these documentary / educational type pieces, but I don't
    really like the "call to action" bit at the end.
    - There were points that just seemed over-produced - excessive transitions,
    sequences with filters for no apparent reason, etc.

- The Questions
    - The call to action part doesn't go far enough - what can one do to "fix" the issue(s)?
    - While patent trolls are obviously bad, but what are the creator's opinion
    about the current state of copyright length?
    - Why was this video done in four parts?

- Your Review
    - I actually enjoyed this quite a bit, despite some of the flaws noted above.
    It was educational, engaging, and well made. However, it's difficult to understand
    *why* it was made, aside from being an educational piece. The creator obviously
    feels strongly about the covered topics, but does nothing to encourage the viewer to
    get involved in free/open source projects or really take any sort of action.
    The ending felt more like it petered out than finished strong...

##[Assignment 2: "Litreview0"](#litreview0)

- Who
    - [Software Freedom Law Center](https://www.softwarefreedom.org/){target=_blank}

- What
    - [*A Legal Issues Primer for Open Source and Free Software Projects*](https://www.softwarefreedom.org/resources/2008/foss-primer.pdf){target=_blank} (Intro to the end of Chapter 2)

- Where
    - [https://www.softwarefreedom.org/resources/2008/foss-primer.pdf](https://www.softwarefreedom.org/resources/2008/foss-primer.pdf){target=_blank}

- When
    - The date on the title page indicates version 1.5.2 was released 2008-06-04

- The Gist
    - This is a FOSS-developer targeted legal primer on a number of issues and
    legal topics relevant to FOSS development. It covers copyright, licensing,
    organizational structure, patents, and trademarks. It is intended to be a
    guideline, not actual cut-and-dried legal advice.

- The Good
    - Links in PDFs are awesome.
    - "If you find yourself feeling the urge to write a new license, itâ€™s a
good sign that you might need to reconsider your approach."
    - I had no idea about the Affero GPL, which seems like an excellent idea.
    I wonder why it's not implemented more widely (or maybe I haven't been looking for it)
- The Bad
    - "...send a letter, via as many different methods as possible (at least by email, courier service, and fax)." Fax? Really?
    - While I understand the need, at points the concentration of acronyms got a little
    unreadable.
    - The section on copyright for documentation seems oddly short, especially after
    they talk up the importance of good documentation.

- The Questions
    - Is there a simple(r) solution for small projects?
    - Is this information globally relevant, or USA specific?
    - Why are there so many versions of the GPL, and what are the differences?

- Your Review
    - It's hard to make legal guidelines / information exciting. I understand that.
    I suppose this could be far less engaging, but given the nature of the material,
    it was engaging enough. More than anything, I'm kind of terrified of FOSS licenses
    and how they interact now. No wonder GPL violations (and other license violations)
    are so common.
