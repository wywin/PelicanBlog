I have now decided that Octopress / Github Pages is my preferred blogging solution. With the hosting headache out of the way, I can safely bounce between VPS providers without worry of disrupting the ones of users who read my semi-helpful posts! I also get the added bonus of multiple copies of my posts in markdown on every computer I edit from! As such, I'll upload some old stuff I wrote on various sites / ages ago as I convert it from Wordpress to Markdown.
