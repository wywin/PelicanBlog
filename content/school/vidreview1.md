The complexity and novelty of the titles has hit rock bottom. Oh well. Here's Vidreview1:

- The Gist
    - This talk is quite similar to Chapter 5 of [*A Legal Issues Primer for Open Source and Free Software Projects*](https://www.softwarefreedom.org/resources/2008/foss-primer.pdf) (PDF), likely because it was (at least in part) written by the same person. It covers trademark, and how it applies and helps / hinders FOSS projects.

- The Good
    - The anecdotes were humorous, and helped reinforce the main points of the talk.
    - I feel like the use of a trademark policy was more clear in the video than the written
    chapter.
    - I was on the fence / confused why a FOSS project needs to trademark things, but
    the example about [Evergreen](http://evergreen-ils.org/){target=_blank} gave a clear
    use case.

- The Bad
    - Not specific to the talk, but some of the questions were too quiet, and the
    slides were occasionally difficult to see. Luckily they were posted [here](http://www.slideshare.net/AllThingsOpen/trademarks-allthingsopen){target=_blank}.
    - Some of the content was redundant to the chapter we *just* read.
    - ORANGE SHIRT GUY STOP JIGGLING YOUR FOOT!

- The Questions
    - If common law trademarks can be enforced, what's the point of registering?
    - Are there downsides to trademarking / registering trademarks?
    - If you use a name frequently without the "™", can you "go back" and enforce
    it if you start using the "™" with it?

- Your Review
    - I can't quite decide if this is a good reinforcement of the content of the reading, or
    is just reduntant information with a smattering of funny stories. While I
    did get good examples of the benefits of trademarking in FOSS projects, it
    seems like the only real use is shutting down the distribution of malicious
     / backdoored versions of your software. Regardless, it was relatively entertaining, informative, and decently paced.
