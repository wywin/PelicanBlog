-  Describe the software project, its purpose and goals.
    -  “The Apache Software Foundation provides support for the Apache community of open-source software projects, which provide software products for the public good.” ([https://www.apache.org/](https://www.apache.org/){target=_blank})
-  Give brief history of the project. When was the Initial Commit? The latest commit?
    -  N/A
-  Who approves patches? How many people?
    -  There is a fantastically large list of commiters organized by project: [https://people.apache.org/committers-by-project](https://people.apache.org/committers-by-project){target=_blank}
-  Who has commit access, or has had patches accepted? How many total?
    -  There are 4,253 people listed on the commiters page. ([https://people.apache.org/committer-index.html](https://people.apache.org/committer-index.html){target=_blank})
-  Has there been any turnover in the Core Team? (i.e. has the top 20% of contributors stayed the same over time? If not, how has it changed?)
    -  N/A. The Apache Software Foundation has an elected board of directors.
-  Does the project have a BDFL, or Lead Developer? (BDFL == Benevolent Dictator for Life)
    -  N/A
-  Are the front and back end developers the same people? What is the proportion of each?
    -  N/A
-  What have been some of the major bugs/problems/issues that have arisen during development? Who is responsible for quality control and bug repair?
    -  N/A
-  How is the project's participation trending and why?
    -  Up, the number of current members is quite large. It may be that they don’t demote users for inactivity, so it is a false sense of growth.
-  In your opinion, does the project pass "The Raptor Test?" (i.e. Would the project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a Velociraptor?) Why or why not?
    -  Yes, the foundation is mainly run by the community so many people would be able step and take over the role.
-  In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or most active 20% of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not?
    -  Yes. The Apache Software Foundation board of directors is elected.
-  Does the project have an official "on-boarding" process in place? (new contributor guides, quickstarts, communication leads who focus specifically on newbies, etc...)
    -  There is a “Get Involved” landing page that directs users to further information: [https://www.apache.org/foundation/getinvolved.html](https://www.apache.org/foundation/getinvolved.html){target=_blank}
-  Does the project have Documentation available? Is it extensive? Does it include code examples?
    -  The ASF has a “top-level” wiki. “This General Wiki is a top-level overview of other wikis at the Apache Software Foundation, as well as overall Foundation-level information, at the bottom of this page.” ([https://wiki.apache.org/general/](https://wiki.apache.org/general/){target=_blank})
-  If you were going to contribute to this project, but ran into trouble or hit blockers, who would you contact, and how?
    -  IRC would likely be the first place to go.
-  Based on these answers, how would you describe the decision making structure/process of this group? Is it hierarchical, consensus building, ruled by a small group, barely contained chaos, or ruled by a single or pair of individuals?
    -  Consensus building.
-  Is this the kind of structure you would enjoy working in? Why, or why not?
    -  The ASF has extensive documentation and guides to getting started on any of the numerous projects it oversees - it seems inviting and friendly.
