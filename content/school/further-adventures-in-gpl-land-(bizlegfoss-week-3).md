##Assignment 1: "Litreview1"

- Who
    - [copyleft.org](http://copyleft.org/guide/){target=_blank}

- What
    - [*Copyleft and the GNU General Public License: A Comprehensive Tutorial and Guide*](http://copyleft.org/guide/){target=_blank} (Chapter 1 specifically)

- Where
    - [http://copyleft.org/guide/](http://copyleft.org/guide/){target=_blank}

- When
    - There are copyright notices dated as late as 2014. So some time in 2014 was the last update.
- The Gist
    - The first chapter of this document explains various aspects of software freedom, such
    as the GPL, copyleft ideology, and the differences between copyleft and public domain.
    It is written in a (relatively) universally understandable way (meaning not
    developer-specific).

- The Good
    - Again, the in-PDF links are fantastic. Some are even to external sources!
    - "It was once rare that this freedom [the freedom to run] was restricted by even proprietary software; but such is quite common today."
        - Since most of my computing has been in the post-EULA era, this was interesting
        to contemplate.
    - I now have a way better understanding of software freedom vs. public domain software.

- The Bad
    - "Copyleft modifies, or 'hacks' copyright law..."
        - The more people use the term "hack" the less I like seeing it. It's been
        muddied and overused, and doesn't really have a concrete meaning anymore.
    - Some of the wording feels a bit biased. It feels more like a persuasive document,
    rather than a general-information document for people trying to learn more about
    software freedom and the GPL.
    - While I love semantics as much as the next guy, it feels like their definitions of
    similar terms are fuzzy at best.

- The Questions
    - Are there any downsides to licensing one's code under the GPL?
    - If one wants to make a living by writing code, is the GPL still viable / appropriate?
    - Are there cases where releasing into the public domain makes more sense than releasing
    under the GPL?

- Your Review
    - While informative, this first chapter wasn't terribly interesting or engaging to read.
    Regardless, it is undoubtedly well written, and exhaustively sourced. Given
    the inherently dry nature of legal writing, it was more than adequate.
