###Which Entity did your team choose to profile?
Atmel / Arudino


###Description of the Organization?

Atmel Corporation is an American-based designer and manufacturer of semiconductors, founded in 1984. The company focuses on embedded systems built around microcontrollers. Its products include microcontrollers (8-bit AVR, 32-bit AVR, ARM-based, automotive grade, and Intel 8051 derivatives) radio frequency (RF) devices including Wi-Fi, EEPROM, and flash memory devices, symmetric and asymmetric security chips, touch sensors and controllers, and application-specific products. Atmel supplies its devices as standard products, application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), or application-specific standard product (ASSPs) depending on the requirements of its customers.

###Description of the project?

Arduino is an open-source computer hardware and software company, project and user community that designs and manufactures kits for building digital devices and interactive objects that can sense and control the physical world.Arduino boards may be purchased preassembled, or as do-it-yourself kits; at the same time, the hardware design information is available for those who would like to assemble an Arduino from scratch.

###Describe each team member's role?

- Wyatt Winters (Lead Writer)
- Caleb Coffie (Lead Researcher)

###Organization/Project Source Code Repository URL?
- [https://github.com/arduino/Arduino](https://github.com/arduino/Arduino){target=_blank}

###List your upstream Mentor's below:

I have submitted a PR to remove this section from the template, since it doesn't really apply.

###What do you anticipate the easy parts will be?
- Arduino has a massive community, so I imagine finding information about it will be quite easy.

###What do you anticipate the hard parts will be?
- Because it is such an open-ended project, it may be difficult to find specific information about business-side of Arudino.

(The part after this is still the same as teamprop0 and teamprop1...)

###How will you overcome both?

The only way to overcome the large hurdles will be to just keep going with the work. Over time many of the confusing parts should be cleared up. We can also contact fellow classmates if we have problems and they might be able to help out.

###If something goes wrong, what contingencies do you have in place?

The only thing that I think might go wrong is a lack of information. To overcome this we can attempt to make contact with those involved in the projects and see if they're able to shed some light on the remaining information.

###When will your group meet regularly outside of class time?

10:30 AM Tues / Thurs.
