- Who
    - [Software Freedom Law Center](https://www.softwarefreedom.org/){target=_blank}

- What
    - [*A Legal Issues Primer for Open Source and Free Software Projects*](https://www.softwarefreedom.org/resources/2008/foss-primer.pdf){target=_blank} (Chapter 4 this time)

- Where
    - [https://www.softwarefreedom.org/resources/2008/foss-primer.pdf](https://www.softwarefreedom.org/resources/2008/foss-primer.pdf){target=_blank}

- When
    - The date on the title page indicates version 1.5.2 was released 2008-06-04

- The Gist
    - Chapter 4 specifically covers software patents, and the various obstacles
    (and generic advice on defenses) that software patents create for FOSS projects
    and developers.

- The Good
    - I have a much better understanding of why software patents are so hated -
    they are confusing, and seem *designed* for exploitation and other nastiness.
    - I find that a legal organization (granted, in a general context) saying
    "design around the obstacle patent" really humorous. That seems like a bad idea,
    for a number of reasons.
    - This may be incorrect, but I'm left with the impression that, if one wants
    to put in the work, most patents can be invalidated (relatively) easily?
    That's encouraging, I suppose.

- The Bad
    - I have difficulty understanding why this document was written. It seems like
    every other paragraph is "consult legal counsel for specific needs" or similar.
    Why wouldn't I just go to a lawyer to begin with? (S)he could probably tell
    me all this information, perhaps more succinctly.
    - The whole section 4.3 "Becoming Aware of a Patent" seems really strange.
    It (from what I understand) pretty much says "wait for them to come to you,
    then get a lawyer". What?!
    - This chapter was even less readable than the last two. I understand why
    lawyers get paid so much - this is difficult to understand, and incredibly
    boring!

- The Questions
    - Given the (from what I can tell) significant outrage about the current state
    of software patents, is there or has there been any attempts at adjusting the laws
    concerning software patents?
    - Of the patent troll cases I've heard of, why are patents granted to such
    vague and generic software patents?
    - Who the heck comes up with the time periods in our legal system? Maintenance
    fees are due every 4.5 years? You can seek damages for infringements occurring
    up to 6 years in the past? *Why those numbers?!*

- Your Review
    - While I did glean some useful knowledge from this chapter, I found most of it useless.
    I feel like most sections were simply "you *could* do this, but you should
    probably just talk to a lawyer". In addition, I'm not sure if I should be *more*
    afraid of software patents, or *less* so since they seem easy to invalidate.
    There was some solid content, but it was buried behind vast walls of legal
    jargon.
