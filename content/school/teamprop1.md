So, I was unclear on this last time, but these are apparently written individually, not as a group. As such, here is my entirely unique Teamprop1 (except that bit at the end, which will probably be the same on all these, unless something drastically changes...):

##Team Proposal

| Name          | Email           | Role            |
|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Caleb Coffie  | csc6972@rit.edu | Lead Researcher |

###Which Entity did your team choose to profile?
Apache Software Foundation

###Description of the Organization?
The Apache Software Foundation /əˈpætʃiː/ (ASF) is an American non-profit corporation (classified as 501(c)(3) in the United States) to support Apache software projects, including the Apache HTTP Server. The ASF was formed from the Apache Group and incorporated in Delaware, U.S., in June 1999. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Software_Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Software_Foundation){target=_blank})

###Description of the project?

The Apache projects are defined by collaborative consensus based processes, an open, pragmatic software license and a desire to create high quality software that leads the way in its field. ([https://www.apache.org/](https://www.apache.org/){target=_blank})

###Describe each team member's role?

- Wyatt Winters (Lead Writer)
- Caleb Coffie (Lead Researcher)

###Organization/Project Source Code Repository URL?
- [https://github.com/apache](https://github.com/apache){target=_blank}
- [http://git.apache.org/](http://git.apache.org/){target=_blank}


###List your upstream Mentor's below:

I think this is held over from HFOSS / some other class, so I'll just say I'll go into #apache on freenode and ask questions there? ([https://wiki.apache.org/general/IRC](https://wiki.apache.org/general/IRC){target=_blank})


###What do you anticipate the easy parts will be?
- Apache has fantastically robust documentation for their software, so I assume (perhaps incorrectly) the same is true of their organizational documentation.

###What do you anticipate the hard parts will be?
- Not all of the questions in the profile will be easy to answer, and may not apply directly.

(The part after this is still the same as teamprop0...)

###How will you overcome both?

The only way to overcome the large hurdles will be to just keep going with the work. Over time many of the confusing parts should be cleared up. We can also contact fellow classmates if we have problems and they might be able to help out.

###If something goes wrong, what contingencies do you have in place?

The only thing that I think might go wrong is a lack of information. To overcome this we can attempt to make contact with those involved in the projects and see if they're able to shed some light on the remaining information.

###When will your group meet regularly outside of class time?

10:30 AM Tues / Thurs.
