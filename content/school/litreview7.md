This litreview is about an article, and a paragraph in another article! Weird! It's Litreview7!

- Who
    - [Open Source Initiative](http://opensource.org/){target=_blank}
    - [copyleft.org](http://copyleft.org/guide/){target=_blank}

- What
    - [*Open Source Case for Business*](http://opensource.org/advocacy/case_for_business.php){target=_blank}
    - [*Copyleft and the GNU General Public License: A Comprehensive Tutorial and Guide*](http://copyleft.org/guide/){target=_blank} (Section 12.1, which is like a paragraph)

- Where
    - [http://opensource.org/advocacy/case_for_business.php](http://opensource.org/advocacy/case_for_business.php){target=_blank}
    - [http://copyleft.org/guide/](http://copyleft.org/guide/){target=_blank}

- When
    - The *Open Source Case for Business* was first indexed by archive.org [2002-06-24](https://web.archive.org/web/20020624034017/http://www.opensource.org/advocacy/case_for_business.php){target=_blank}, so we'll call that the publish date.
    - The Copyleft Guide has copyright notices dated 2014, so the last revision was sometime then.

- The Gist
    - *Open Source Case for Business* outlines and explains the various benefits for business for getting involved in open source development. It also outlines the various business models that an open source business may use.
    - The Copyleft Guide (Section 12.1) notes that using GPL'd software in the enterprise is not only cheap (as in free), it's easy!

- The Good
    - I've never heard the term "widget frosting," but I find it quite amusing.
    - "The first bazaar project in a given niche is more likely to attract the best co-developers to invest time in it."
    - "If builders built houses the way programmers built programs, the first woodpecker to come along would destroy civilization."

- The Bad
    - "...high technology products (laptops, personal assistants, cellphones, etc)" Isn't there usually a "digital" in "personal [digital] assistant?" Even then, nobody actually talks about PDAs anymore.
    - "In today's fast-moving, short-product-cycle business climate" ***BUZZWORDS!***
    - "Open-source authors frequently find themselves receving [sic], for free, port changes for operating systems and environments they barely know exist and can't afford developers to support." Perhaps this is just my lack of knowledge, but is this actually that frequent?

- The Questions
    - If you create software for sale, how does open source development work? People can just compile their own version. Do you just assume most people can't / are too lazy to do that?
    - "Using Free Software has a substantially lower cost of ownership" Isn't it free? Is that just strangely worded, or are there costs associated with free software I'm not thinking of?
    - "In an independent head-to-head reliability test, open-source Unix systems and utilities were less fragile - crashed or hung less often - than their proprietary counterparts." Citation needed? You can't just say that without citing a source.

- Your Review
    - I found this article a little hyperbolic. It makes grand claims, some of which are backed up, some of which are unsubstantiated. In general, it provides a decent outlines of the benefits of open source for all businesses - those who already have a foot in the FOSS space, and those looking to make inroads into it.
