- When
    - "Received 25 November 2014; revised 15 December 2014; accepted 25 December 2014"

- The Gist
    - This paper creates(?) three different metrics for evaluating the cost/time saving potential of open source hardware, and then presents a case study illustrating the cost/time saving ability of open source hardware.

- The Good
    - FOSH is a really silly sounding acronym.
    - It is exhaustively sourced (which I guess is normal for academic papers), but if you have been following these litreviews (and if you aren't Remy, why would you be), you know I like citations.
    - "electrospinning novel materials" is a fantastic phrase, even if it has *extremely* limited applications.

- The Bad
    - I think Creative Commons is technically a proper noun? The first paragraph has it lowercase.
    - "open-source syringe pump (OSSP)" I'm not sure that really deserves its own acronym.
    - "ranged from over $64,000 to over $1,000,000 for P = 1" Well, that's not a terribly specific range, is it? That's more of a guess.

- The Questions
    - Wouldn't a whole bunch of designers be out of jobs if open source hardware took off?
    - If an important open source medical device fails and someone dies, where does the liability fall?
    - If the range of potential savings is so wide, can you really deem this "successfully provid[ing] three methods of quantifying the value of free and open source hardware"?

- Your Review
    - This is a well written, well organized paper. It provides clear examples, and is (relatively) easy to follow. However, I have difficulty comprehending the vast ranges of potential savings he presents - I know there is some guess work to be done, but a range of $1,000,000 is nothing to sneeze at. I suppose I've never done anything like this, so a million may in fact be a very small range, but I wouldn't know.
