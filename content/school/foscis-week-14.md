- When
    - 2014-10-16 for the article, 2014-09-19 for the interview
- The Gist
    - "The Dark Market for Personal Data" is pretty much as it says on the tin. It covers the secretive world of data brokers, and the numerous perils of their systems.
    - "Interview on The Black Box Society" provides background on the book, and insights into some of the decisions / thought processes of the author.
- The Good
    - "Scurrilous" is a wonderful word.
    - While I would like to embrace data brokers for the dystopian cyberpunk future they're inevitably leading us to, that would be with the condition they actually know what the hell they're doing. If their lists and data are wrong half the time, they don't really accomplish much, and just make things worse for people they wrongly categorize. Until they get their data algorithms fixed, they probably should be regulated more heavily.
    - That art (?) on the sidebar of the article is pretty great.
- The Bad
    - "The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or Hipaa" Not quite there Frank. Acronyms are generally all caps, yeah? What sort of editor didn't catch that?
    - "These problems can’t be solved with existing law." Three paragraphs later: "Privacy protections in other areas of the law can and should be extended to cover consumer data." 
    - "The book’s method of analysis--could you explain it?" That's an awkwardly phrased question, isn't it?
- The Questions
    + Has there been any legal progress on data brokers since these articles were published?
    + What other lists are compiled by data brokers? I imagine there's some pretty specific stuff.
    + Can you buy your own data from data brokers?
- Your Review
    - This just seems like another set of articles that could be summed up as "Bad stuff is bad. I do not like bad stuff. Here is why. Now you also do not like bad stuff." I know I'm dreadfully cynical, but a large number of the articles I've read for this course have been incredibly similar. I don't know if that's the bias of the professor, or if all the commentary around tech issues is this homogeneous.
