This time, it's a full length movie film! And 4 pages of book scans! It still doesn't make sense, slightly delayed because of this Github DDoS, it's week 8 of FOSCIS:

- When
    - 1968 for "The Death of the Author"
    - 2009 for *RiP: A Remix Manifesto*
- The Gist
    + "Death" is a wildly incomprehensible essay about, as far as I can tell, how masterpieces of writing are those which the author is "dead" - his or her views and biases cease to exist inside the written work. Or something like that.
    + *RiP* is (yet another) film about remix culture, copyright / fair use law, and everything in between.
- The Good
    - Holy crap, that fake Disneyland in China is incredible. Apparently, there is an official Disney park opening [quite soon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Disney_Resort){target=_blank}. (It's also confusing, as the text and spoken language was Japanese, but the video claims the park was in China. I assume that to be true, but still strange.)
    - I was not aware of Brazil's significant remix culture. How cool is it that their former Minister of Culture was also an active musician?
    - I think I actually stumbled across scans of Air Pirate comics *ages* ago, and had no idea about the backstory.
- The Bad
    - I'm not sure what the best b-roll choice is when you want to play and focus on music, but having a tenth of your movie be people dancing is perhaps a bit redundant.
    - Speaking of redundant, after having watched [*Everything is a Remix*](http://everythingisaremix.info/){target=_blank} for BizLeg a few months back, this was more of the same, but better executed.
    - Good *God* is "Death" unreadable. This is becoming an alarming trend with these sloppily-scanned PDFs. I can't critique it very much, as that would require thorough understanding.
- The Questions
    + There seems to be a number of vocal critics, but is change even possible given the ***vast*** amounts of money that copyright lobbying groups have?
    + Why was opensourcecinema.org shut down? 
    + Were any revisions or derivative works created based on *RiP*?
- Your Review
    - I quite enjoyed *RiP*, despite the fact that a good portion of it was preaching to the choir. I learned about some figures and areas of remix / open culture I didn't previously know about, and got to watch people dancing for a disproportionate amount of time! 
    
    4/5 <review increments\>

    - As for "Death", well, you know. I guess I'm just not on a high enough arcane plane to comprehend it...
