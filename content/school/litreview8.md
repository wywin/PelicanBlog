- Who
    - [Jean Tirole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Tirole){target=_blank}

- What
    - ["Market power and regulation"](http://www.kva.se/globalassets/priser/ekonomi/2014/pop_ek_en_14.pdf){target=_blank} (It's a little unclear who wrote this document, as I'm sure six pages isn't enough to warrant a Nobel prize. It is however a summation of Jean Tirole's ideas, so we'll credit him.)

- Where
    - [http://www.kva.se/globalassets/priser/ekonomi/2014/pop_ek_en_14.pdf](http://www.kva.se/globalassets/priser/ekonomi/2014/pop_ek_en_14.pdf){target=_blank}

- When
    - 2014

- The Gist
    - The PDF in question is a summation of a likely very dense economic paper. It covers Mr. Tirole's contributions to economic theory about oligopoly - where one market is controlled by a handful of very powerful companies.

- The Good
    - That illustration on the first page is pretty spectacular.
    - "mastering one link of a chain can allow a monopolist to make profits in the market of the next link."
    - "Tirole’s research would come to build upon new scientific methods, particularly in game theory and contract theory." - There's such a thing as "contract theory"‽

- The Bad
    - I'm not sure whose fault this really is, but this is a very mysterious document. Who wrote it? Was it Mr. Tirole? If so, why is he writing in the third person? A little more background would be nice.
    - I'm not entirely sure how this fits in with the course. Sure, it's business and all, but how does it relate to FOSS?
    - "Even with a well-designed framework, a regulator will sometimes appear to be an advocate of the firm, but despite this she will nevertheless not allow herself to be bribed or actively withhold information." - This sentence is tremendously confusing.

- The Questions
    - The idea of "asymmetric information" is a perplexing. If one is a regulatory body, couldn't you make laws and then demand whatever information you wanted?
    - The document mentions "a menu of ingeniously constructed contracts," and then goes on to discuss exactly two kinds. Are there more, or is it just a very short menu?
    - I don't spend a whole lot of time thinking about economics, but how did the concept of an oligopoly not exist in economic theory before Mr. Tirole's work?

- Your Review
    - I don't feel particularly strongly about this document. It was mildly interesting, was well written, and conveyed information adequately. Beyond that, it is rather unremarkable.
