As BIZLEGFOSS wraps up, so approaches the final "exam". However, this exam is less typical than most, in that we (the students) get to help write it? At least that's what I think is going on.

Anyways, here's my 3 suggestions for questions:

- What topic/subject/section would you want to expand on?
- what topic/subject/section would you want to remove / minimize?
- What was your least favorite part of the course?

I imagine a lot of the other responses will be pretty similar, but there you are.
