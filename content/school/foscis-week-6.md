This week's articles are about Net Neutrality. This is somewhat strange, since the FCC [already passed Title II](http://www.theverge.com/2015/2/26/8114265/fcc-ruling-net-neutrality-victory-internet-title-ii){target=_blank} a couple weeks ago. I suppose this is where taking this class as independent study sort of falls apart, but no matter.

Since these articles are relatively short, I'll combine them into one litreview.

- When
    - Mr. Bogost's article is dated 2014-05-15.
    - Ms. Glaser's article is dated 2014-09-10.

- The Gist
    - Mr. Bogost's article questions the value of net neutrality, the validity of the openness of the current internet, and the (perceived) negative effects of the internet on daily life.
    - Ms. Glaser's article takes a decidedly opposite stance, spelling out the numerous potential dangers of a non-neutral internet, and (as is typical of the EFF) a call to action.

- The Good
    - Ms. Glaser's article is well cited, and gives specific examples of adverse effects enabled by not having strong net neutrality laws.
    - While I vehemently oppose almost all of the ideas presented in it, Mr. Bogost's article is quite well written. "The weight and heat of your smartphone in your pocket, silently whimpering for you, a glass and metal kitten with a small, fragile body."
    - From Ms. Glaser's article: "This is a particular concern as more Internet providers expand into content production and distribution. Network discrimination could be used to herd users towards services the ISPs offer, like Verizonâ€™s RedBox, rather than their competitors." - This was always one of the examples I gave when having to explain net neutrality to someone less technically-oriented.

- The Bad
    - Ian Bogost must be a profoundly unhappy man. He seems to have little hope, is dismissive, and wants to (apparently) let the internet burn. I feel like this article is largely dominated by emotion, and has immense leaps in logic.
    - He seems to think that because giants like Facebook and Twitter exist, that new players can't enter the field. As such, implementing laws that hold that door open (however narrow it may be) are pointless. Sure, you may think things are bad, but why would not at least try to keep things from getting worse? Why would you just give up?
    - This seems to be a common thread in the (admittedly very small) selection of anti-net-neutrality / anti-anonymity articles I have read - the authors seem to think that social media services are mandatory! "Sitting in front of the television, you grasp your iPhone tight in your hand instead of your knitting or your whiskey or your rosary or your lover." I mean, you don't have to. You are more than welcome to pick up any of those other objects (or people, as the case may be).
    - "You boot a browser and it loads the Yahoo! homepage" - so *that's* why this guy is so jaded by the internet. I would be too, if I had to look at Yahoo! every time I loaded my browser.


- The Questions
    - Does the FCC's Title II ruling "save" the internet, or are there still more steps to take?
    - When do the new laws go into effect?
    - Have there been any scientific studies on adverse effects / mental health implications of Mr. Bogost's so called "sins" that he outlines?

- Your Review
    - I got most of it out in the "the bad" section, but holy crap, I couldn't agree less with Mr. Bogost. I mean, yeah, there are some super awful parts of the internet, and that sucks. There are also super awful parts of the real world, and that also sucks. I'm not sure giving up on fixing the internet and letting it get monetized and corrupted into an unrecognizable nightmare is the best course of action. If someone's being a jerk, don't engage them, block them, and move on. The benefits of the internet (especially a neutral one) ***far*** outweight the negatives.

    Bogost - -3/5 <review increments\>

    - Ms. Glaser's article is much more to my liking, and not only because its ideas are much more in line with my own. It is less emotional (although there are still a handful of weasel words), and provides very clear, specific, and cited examples.

    Glaser - 4/5 <review increments\>
