Automattic/Wordpress

###Description of the Organization?
Automattic, Inc. is a web development corporation founded in August 2005. It is most notable for WordPress.com (a free blogging service), as well as its contributions to WordPress (open source blogging software). The company's name plays on its founder's first name, Matt.

###List your upstream Mentor's below:

None as of yet. We still will need to make contact with someone on their Slack. Currently waiting for an Invite.
How will you communicate with them? (i.e. IRC Channel, Email Addresses, mail lists, issue trackers, etc...)

Slack: https://wordpress.slack.com/
IRC(old): #wordpress @ freenode


###What do you anticipate the easy parts will be?
- Wordpress is pretty gigantic, so information should be easy to come by.

###What do you anticipate the hard parts will be?
- We're all making this up as we go, so the actual presentations / profiles are going to be weird the first couple times.
- This form doesn't seem completely appropriate for making short-term presentation teams, so making up answers for these questions is difficult.

###How will you overcome both?

The only way to overcome the large hurdles will be to just keep going with the work. Over time many of the confusing parts should be cleared up. We can also contact fellow classmates if we have problems and they might be able to help out.

###If something goes wrong, what contingencies do you have in place?

The only thing that I think might go wrong is a lack of information. To overcome this we can attempt to make contact with those involved in the projects and see if they're able to shed some light on the remaining information.

###When will your group meet regularly outside of class time?

10:30 AM Tues / Thurs.
