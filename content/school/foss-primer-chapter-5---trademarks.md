- Who
    - [Software Freedom Law Center](https://www.softwarefreedom.org/){target=_blank}

- What
    - [*A Legal Issues Primer for Open Source and Free Software Projects*](https://www.softwarefreedom.org/resources/2008/foss-primer.pdf){target=_blank} (Chapter 5 this time)

- Where
    - [https://www.softwarefreedom.org/resources/2008/foss-primer.pdf](https://www.softwarefreedom.org/resources/2008/foss-primer.pdf){target=_blank}

- When
    - The date on the title page indicates version 1.5.2 was released 2008-06-04

- The Gist
    - Chapter 5 covers trademarks (both common law and registered), and how they
    apply to and are used by FOSS projects.

- The Good
    - The term "genericide" is pretty fantastic. I was familiar with the concept,
     but never had a name attached to it. What fun!
    - I have a much more thorough understanding of "™" vs "®", and how each differ.
    - The definition for class 9 trademarks is fantastic:

    >"Scientific, nautical, surveying, photographic, cinematographic, optical, weighing, measuring, signalling [sic], checking (supervision), life-saving and teaching apparatus and instruments; apparatus and instruments for conducting, switching, transforming, accumulating, regulating or controlling electricity; apparatus for recording, transmission or reproduction of sound or images; magnetic data carriers, recording discs; compact discs, DVDs and other digital recording media; mechanisms for coin-operated apparatus; cash registers, calculating machines, data processing equipment, computers; computer software; fire-extinguishing apparatus." ([Source](http://www.uspto.gov/trademark/trademark-updates-and-announcements/nice-agreement-tenth-edition-general-remarks-class){target=_blank})

    Because *of course* computers and fire-extinguishing equipment are
    in the same category. Also worth noting:

    >"This Class includes, in particular: ... protractors;"

    Are there enough trademarks for brands of protractors being filed that this is necessary
    to include?!

- The Bad
    - The section on Cease and Desist letters seems oddly short. Granted, it is
    difficult to give generic advice for such, but it seems like it should be
    more verbose, given how frequent (and scary) C&Ds are.
    - "use your trademark in a consistent and distinctive manner." I'm not writing
    master, but this seems like a bad idea - both from a readability perspective,
    and also from a not-seeming-like-a-self-important-weirdo perspective. If the
    word in question is in **bold** every time it's used, that seems off-putting.
    - In my continuing train of being picky about grammar / spelling, "signaling"
    is spelled wrong in the Class 9 description. In addition, there are *numerous*
    instances of British English: "jewellery," "colours," "tyres". What?!

- The Questions
    - As most FOSS projects are global (or at least have global reach),
    are United States trademarks enforceable in other countries?
    - When is it worth the trouble to register one's common law trademark?
    - Do trademark applications ever get rejected, and if so, for what reasons?

- Your Review
    - This chapter was significantly more helpful than the last. I definitely
    have a better understanding of trademarks, and I feel like I could register
    and enforce one with relative ease, provided I actually had anything worth
    trademarking. The more I read legal things, it all seems so murky and
    case-by-case that it's amazing there's any consistency to any of it. What
    a strange set of systems.
