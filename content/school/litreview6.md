It's time to finish that FOSS primer, albeit a little out of order! Here's Litreview6:

- Who
    - [Software Freedom Law Center](https://www.softwarefreedom.org/){target=_blank}

- What
    - [*A Legal Issues Primer for Open Source and Free Software Projects*](https://www.softwarefreedom.org/resources/2008/foss-primer.pdf){target=_blank} (Chapter *3* this time!)

- Where
    - [https://www.softwarefreedom.org/resources/2008/foss-primer.pdf](https://www.softwarefreedom.org/resources/2008/foss-primer.pdf){target=_blank}

- When
    - The date on the title page indicates version 1.5.2 was released 2008-06-04

- The Gist
    - This chapter covers organizational issues and obstacles, the various organizational structures that may be appropriate for a FOSS project, how to file taxes, and (hopefully) not get sued.

- The Good
    - If I ever want to start a non-profit, I have a much better (if still rough) understanding of how to do that.
    - For being such a notoriously strict organization, I still find it hilarious that there are official IRS forms that end in "EZ."
    - I feel like this chapter specifically does a decent job of going *just* deep enough on each topic to allow me to make better decisions on which organizational structures / forms to research further.

- The Bad
    - "The law offers no clear test for what amounts
to a substantial amount of legislative activities." Well, that's a bit of an oversight isn't it?
    - For a chapter about organizational structures, it seems to go from "Well, you could be one of these" to "You're a 501(c)(3), here's what to do now" pretty quickly.
    - I really don't understand most of the section about directors. "They must promote the organizationâ€™s mission and avoid acting in self interest." Well, obviously? Why would one ever appoint a selfish, malicious director?


- The Questions
    - Are "duty of care" and "duty of loyalty" actual legal terms, and do they really need to be defined? One would hope whoever you are making a director would already fulfill those.
    - Is starting a non-profit without legal counsel feasible (even if it's not advisable)?
    - How do things change when projects have developers from multiple countries?

- Your Review
    - As someone who doesn't plan on starting an organization any time soon (and will likely try and avoid it, as it sounds rather treacherous), this chapter wasn't terribly engaging. However, reading the sections about non-profits was educational - knowing that there is at least some level accountability is encouraging. Should the inescapable need to form a non-profit arise, I would have at least a better idea of things to discuss with legal counsel.
